## **Project description:**

Historical data on game sales, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation) were provided. 
We needed to identify patterns that determine the success of a game. This will allow to bet on a potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns for the shops in particular area.
Additionally we need to create customer profiles for NA, EU and JP regions to identify sale strategies in the regions based on customer journey.
Hypothesis was suggested that average user ratings for Xbox One and PC platforms are the same and average user ratings for Action and Sports genres are different and we need to statistically prove or disprove it.

## **Project timeline:**

* Data was thoroughly checked for missing items, outliner and other irregularities that can affect the result. Additionally data types were corrected.
* EDA was performed to understand data influence on sales and if there are any platform specifics.
* Customer profile was created for each region based on data to identify preferences
* Games ratings impact on sales was checked
* Hypotheses were tested to check if they are correct or not
* Summary was made for the business based on the data.

## **Project result:**

Business needed to know which product to bet on to get the maximum profit? Here are the conclusions we came to after analyzing the data provided:

* It is better to focus on promoting games with critic and user ratings of around 7-8 points, as such games have a higher chance of selling well.
* For North America region preference should be given to games of the Action, Shooter or Sports genres. About 40% of the assortment should be for current Microsoft consoles.
* For European Union region preference should be given also to Action, Shooter or Sports genres. About 50% of the assortment should be for current Sony consoles.
* For Japan region preference should be given to games of the RPG or Action genres. About 60% of the assortment should be for current Nintendo consoles.
