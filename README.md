## **Project description**

Historical data on game sales, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation) are available from open sources. 
You need to identify patterns that determine the success of a game. This will allow to bet on a potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns.

Project is made with **Python** and in **Jupyter Notebook** format.
